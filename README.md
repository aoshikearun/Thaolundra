#THAOLUNDRA MULTIPLAYER

This is a Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint 3D game Project using both Advanced Locomotion System v4 and Dynamic Combat System from the Epic Marketplace. The objective is to create a game prototype mainly capable of multiplayer PvP matches. The project is managed by Enio Fortes and directed by Aoshi Kearun. Aoshi is also the only programmer so far and coding using mainly the UE5 blueprint system. We also have two very talented concept artists Tiago "Mushi" Monteiro and Thais Campos, and the musical composer and performer Luis "Chico" Gomes as well. This team also was concepted to act as a creative assembly, equally voiced in the creative decisions made for the project. The project is yet not funded, but it aims to create a crowdfunding campaign as soon as the main test phase ends.


###1. What is Thaolundra?

It is a scenario for TTRPG d100 system adapted from Runequest created by Aoshi Kearun. The scenario consist in a planet called Thaolundra with a variety of elementally and technologically powered individuals, landscapes and dungeons. A story played by dozens of players for almost 22 years. You can learn more and even play a session accessing the link [Thaolundra TTRPG](http://thaolundra.bubbleapps.io "Thaolundra TTRPG").

###2. The Game
The game will initially consist in a multi-objective RPG arena where you can choose atributes, weapons and a elemental power source for your techniques, while battling in a total of 4 levels. The goal is to translate the multifaceted combat together with the immersive sense of exploration to the videogame medium through - initially - fast paced and customizable combat experience and later with story-driven campaigns.

###3. Content
As for now the team is not nearly enough to make a full-fledged game, so we are taking our time with the development and dividing our content creation into bits we can actually finish. For now, all 3D content: static and skeleton meshes, animations, etc; are pre-made and from the epic marketplace, but we do intend to make some of them our own in the future. For the hour we are dividing our content in the following categories.
